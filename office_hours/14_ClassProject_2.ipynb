    "For our class project, we are going to dive into the world of cryptography. We will work our way through coding several historical ciphers; from the easily breakable Caesar and Substitution Ciphers to the more complex Vigenere Cipher. In the end, you will be able to send your friends and family secret messages, that they can decode with your code.\n",

    "Next, we will work on a more complex mathematical cipher. For this exercise, we'll write a program to implement a Vigenere Cipher, that encrypts alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword.\n",

    "It turns out that the Substitution Cipher wasn't a great cipher either; in fact, most newspapers carry a daily puzzle about solving a substitution cipher.  Anything that someone can figure out for fun in an afternoon is not a very secure secret code!\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1553, a new way of writing secret codes became the new state of the art and stayed that way for centuries.  For about 300 years, there was a secret code called \"le chiffre indechiffrable\" (the indecipherable cipher) - the Vigenere Cipher.  It wasn't cracked until mathematicians began to study it in the mid-1800s, applying sophisticated statistical analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the Vigenere Cipher works.  First, pick a key word; let's say \"TEST\".  Then, pick a message you want to encode; let's say \"THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG\".  Imagine writing out the message, and then writing the key word over and over underneath it.  Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG\n",
    "TESTTESTTESTTESTTESTTESTTESTTESTTEST\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To encode the message, go column by column.  Take the two letters in each column and convert them to indices in the alphabet (like Python does, starting with \"A\" = 0).  Add the two numbers together.  Then, wrapping around if necessary, convert back to a letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the first column contains \"T\" and another \"T\".  In a zero-indexed alphabet, \"T\" is index 19.  So, the first column becomes 19 + 19 = 38.  There are only 26 letters in the alphabet, so imagine counting 0 to 25 and then starting over at the beginning again, where 26 goes back to A.  Counting to 38 ends on M.  (Another way to think about this is that 38 - 26 = 12, and the letter at index 12 is M.)  So, the first column is encoded to the letter M.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second column is H + E, or 7 + 4, or 11, or L.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, the full message encodes this way:\n",
